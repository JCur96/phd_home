## Chapter 1, literature review and proposal
Camera trapping is a widely utilised method in ecology and conservation, as it is relatively cheap to delpoy, less invasive than and as effective if not more so than manual methods for detecting and monitoring animals. However, camera trapping as a methodology suffers the major drawback of generating an over abundance of data, all of which requires labelling. This means that the labour burden has been shifted from the field to desk work. Artificial intelligence holds the potential to automate so or all of the labelling process through the use of computer vision techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
